### Welcome to RAAF Base East Sale (YMES)
As part of your flying training here at RAAF Virtual, we welcome you to the Elementary Flying Training Course in the Diamond DA40 NG at RAAFv Base East Sale.

Prior to your first flight at East Sale (ICAO: YMES), a RAAF Virtual Qualified Flight Instructor (vQFI) can be made available to you for support or briefing prior to you undertaking your initial sortie to ensure your software and components are functional for the course.  

Please ensure you have downloaded and installed the contents of 'Module 1 - Course Resources' prior to undertaking this course.

Should you require further assistance at this stage, please join the RAAF Virtual Discord Server and inform one of the vQFIs of your availability.  This can be done by contacting your instructor via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/293624265633431562/864280594749849600">efts-discussion Discord text channel.</a>
