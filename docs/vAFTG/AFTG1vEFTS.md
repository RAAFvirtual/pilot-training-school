### Introduction
Welcome to the vElementary Flight Training Course in the DA40NG for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This may be your first introduction to flying on the VATSIM network or first time flying Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and along with the RAAFv instructors, we will be using the VATSIM Pilot Learning Centre to provide you the confidence and competence with flying on the VATSIM network.

This course has a total of six repeatable lessons, in RAAFv we call them “Sorties” and your progression through these sorties will be aided by the RAAFv Qualified Flight Instructors (QFI) to help gain your successful completion of this course. “Repeatable Sorties” are sorties that are signed off by the QFI after each flight and by simply completing the sortie, it does not imply that sortie to be successful and may be required to be flown again. Feedback will provided to speed up your success. 

### Reason
After the successful completion of this course you will gain your DA40NG aircraft endorsement for RAAFv and will be eligible for sitting your Military Pilot Licence (MPL) 1 (when it gets implemented)

### Course Learning Outcomes (CLO)  
On successful completion of this course you will be able to confidentially conduct the following:  

* Perform pre-flight administrative actions (METAR, Crew Portal, Flight Filing).  
* Perform RAAFv related systems actions (ACARS, vPilot, Voltana, JoinFS).  
* Demonstrate understanding of Radio Telephony.  
* Demonstrate basic VFR flying.  
* Demonstrate understanding of VATSIM airspaces.

### Sorties
#### vEFTC - Sortie 1 (EGF-1)
**Flight Administration & Airborne Activities**

In this lesson, you will learn the required pre and post-flight actions for RAAF Virtual activities on the VATSIM network along with common ground and circuit procedures for RAAFv Base East Sale.

??? "SORTIE 1 LO1: PERFORM PRE-FLIGHT ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS"
    1. Locate suitable METAR information for the departure and arrival airport prior to flight.  
    2. Perform a risk assessment for the sortie by taking into account departure, cruise and arrival conditions and contributing factors.  
    3. Determine suitable airframe availability.  
    4. Mitigate risk by making calculated judgment and referring to a QFI where practical.  
    5. Connect appropriate software from simulator to RAAFv networks (vPilot, ACARS, JoinFS etc).  
    6. File an appropriate flight-plan on VATSIM using vPilot.  
    7. Set the simulation conditions correctly based on real world conditions, or as required to meet the lesson objectives.
    
??? "SORTIE 1 LO2: PERFORM GROUND & AIR OPERATIONS WITHIN THE YMES CIRTUIT AREA"  

    1. Perform ground based checklist actions to set up and configure the aircraft for safe flight.  
    2. Peform engine start procedures.  
    3. Perform taxi.  
    4. Perform the following as part of a standard circuit pattern;   
        * Perform a standing take-off.
        * Perform a normal climb and level off.
        * Perform a statndard circuits pattern.
        * Perform trimming of the aircraft.
        * Perform straight and level flight.
        * Perform a standard turn (updind → crosswing → downwind → base → final).
        * Perform a normal landing.
        * Perform in-flight checks.
        * Perform radio communications.
        * Manage situationsal awareness in flight.

??? "SORTIE 1 LO3: PERFORM POST-FLIGHT ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS"  

     1. Complete the following post-flight actions:
        * End flight on ACARS prior to disconnecting from VATSIM.
        * Disconnect appropraite software from the simulator to networks (vPilot, JoinFS, YourControls etc).
