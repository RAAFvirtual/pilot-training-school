### Introduction
Welcome to the vElementary Flight Training Course in the DA40NG for Microsoft Flight Simulator. This may be your first introduction to flying on the VATSIM network or first time flying Visual Flight Rules (VFR) and along with the RAAFv instructors, we will be using the VATSIM Pilot Learning Centre to provide you the confidence and competence with flying on the VATSIM network.

This course has a total of six repeatable lessons, in RAAFv we call them “Sorties” and your progression through these sorties will be aided by the RAAFv Qualified Flight Instructors (QFI) to help gain your successful completion of this course. “Repeatable Sorties” are sorties that are signed off by the QFI after each flight and by simply completing the sortie, it does not imply that sortie to be successful and may be required to be flown again. Feedback will provided to speed up your success. 

### Reason
After the successful completion of this course you will gain your DA40NG aircraft endorsement for RAAFv and will be eligible for sitting your Military Pilot Licence (MPL) 1 (when it gets implemented)

### Course Learning Outcomes (CLO)  
On successful completion of this course you will be able to confidentially conduct the following:  

* Perform pre-flight administrative actions (METAR, Crew Portal, Flight Filing).  
* Perform RAAFv related systems actions (ACARS, vPilot, Voltana, JoinFS).  
* Demonstrate understanding of Radio Telephony.  
* Demonstrate basic VFR flying.  
* Demonstrate understanding of VATSIM airspaces.

### Conclusion
Well done on completing your first RAAFv aircraft endorsement course! With this brand new qualification you are permitted to fly the DA40NG on ACARS within the R360 airspace without a QFI onboard. You are confined to the R360 (YMES Training Area) until you have completed v2FTS. This will allow the DA40 aircraft to remain at YMES for the other students. You are welcome to fly the DA40 without being on ACARS anywhere, however we'd like to see you focus on your next course, **IN THE PC21!!!**
